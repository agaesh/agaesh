Hi, I'm Agaesh — a backend developer who enjoys building practical and efficient systems. I specialize in creating RESTful APIs, managing server-side logic, and integrating frontend frameworks like React and Laravel to deliver full-stack solutions.

Right now, I’m working with Node.js, Express, and Firebase, and I’m always learning to improve my craft — from CRUD systems to scalable project architecture.

If you’re working on something meaningful and need a backend hand, feel free to reach out: agaeshK@gmail.com
